Abstract (Project Overview)
An Online Banking System is a secure, web-based and mobile-accessible platform that allows bank customers to perform financial transactions and manage their accounts remotely over the internet, 24/7, without visiting a physical branch. It provides services such as account balance inquiry, fund transfers, bill payments, transaction history, loan applications, credit/debit card management, and customer support, while ensuring high security, regulatory compliance (e.g., PCI-DSS, GDPR, KYC/AML), and seamless integration with the bank’s core banking system.
